# pde-solidification-matlab-materials-science
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a numerical model to simulate heat transfer and solidification in a steel ingot using partial differential equations (PDEs). The model applies an explicit finite difference scheme to solve the transient heat conduction equation with phase change.
